0.7.4
* bug fix in Pdu.encode() that failed to add sysUpTime and trapObjectID to VbList with 0 items in SNMPv2 TRAPs/INFORMs. Thanks to Michal Narwojsz for report and fix.
0.7.3
* reverted to using Array.Copy from Buffer.BlockCopy to fix newly introduced bug (no performance benefit from Buffer.BlockCopy)
0.7.2

* added Oid.CompareExact(int[]) and Oid.CompareExact(Oid) methods for exact Oid comparison (not lexographical)

TODO:
 * version 3 TRAP and INFORM handling is not done
 * build a better abstraction of transport classes to allow additional protocol implementation
  - ITransport interface should be base for all transport classes
  - IAddress interface should be base for all address information (for example, IP address + UDP port for IP/UDP) classes
  - ITarget interface should be base for all target classes
